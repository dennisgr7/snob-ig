//! `snob watch`: the monitor.

//! What is here so far is the read half — `snob watch diff`, which answers
//! "what has changed since the last time anything was reported" out of storage
//! alone, without spending a request. The scheduled half is built on top of the

//!
//! Wording, dates and exit codes live here. What actually changed is
//! [`crate::engine::watch`]'s answer, and this never recomputes any of it.
